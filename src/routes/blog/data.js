        <h3> the begining</h3>
        <p>
        So there is an interesting long history to the creation fo Ffh as a product, a lot of thinking went into building out the whole app. 
        we basically wanted to make FFH as an app that can help transalte real world words to equivalent contracts that are semi legally binding. 
        In a way we wanted to make some sort of an app that can bring actual **Smart Contracts** with real world financial rails and a system that 
        allows people to transact and make money. </p>

        <h3>the app works in multitude of ways </h3>
        <p> SO basically it works by getting people to commit money , discuss deals and discuss the details of the contract. Then once you are 
        done discussing the details of the contract, one of the participants will presss the AI button , which will then go through the conversation
        then make a semi-legally binding contract with specifics, it will also auto select the different types of proofs
         needed to ascertain the conditions in the contract. it will then convert this into a monetary obligation with a pledge amount and more.
